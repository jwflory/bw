Python command-line tool to convert MediaWiki pages to Markdown with pandoc


## About

bye_wiki (`bw`) is a Python command-line script to convert MediaWiki pages into Markdown.
This facilitates an easier migration of existing documentation into a new documentation toolchain.
Regardless of whatever tool or framework is chosen for a future docs solution, this tool enables migrating content.
Instead of manually copy-pasting data, run a script to convert a large set of MusicBrainz MediaWiki URLs to plain Markdown files.
You can use these in virtually any chosen tool in the end!

Check back soon for more progress.
