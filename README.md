Python command-line tool to convert MusicBrainz MediaWiki pages to Markdown with pandoc


## About

metabrainz_wikibye is a Python command-line tool to convert MusicBrainz MediaWiki pages to Markdown.
This facilitates an easier migration of existing documentation into a new documentation toolchain.
Regardless of whatever tool or framework is chosen for a future docs solution, this tool enables migrating content.
Instead of manually copy-pasting data, run a script to convert a large set of MusicBrainz MediaWiki URLs to plain Markdown files.
You can use these in virtually any chosen tool in the end!
